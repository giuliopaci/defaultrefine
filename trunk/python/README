    The Python G2P module is a Python extension to the C++ G2P library 
    originally written by Marelie Davel.

Getting started
---------------

    Be sure the G2P library is built and in your library path with 
    something like the following:

        $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH='/usr/local/lib'

    For more information about building the G2P library see 'cpp/README'.

    Using the Python shell from the project "python" directory execute the 
    following:

        $ python
        >>> from g2p import *
        >>> g2p = G2P()
        >>> dict = \
            DictionaryFile().from_file('test_data/setswana-dict/setswana.dict')
        >>> g2p.set_dictionary(dict)
        >>> g2p.update_rules()
        >>> phones = g2p.predict_pronunciation('hello')
        >>> print "result:", phones

    To run regression test cases execute the following from whithin the 
    "python/g2p" directory:

        $ python g2p.py

Installing
