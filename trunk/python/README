    The Python G2P module is a Python extension to the C++ G2P library originally written
    by Marelie Davel.

Getting started
---------------

    Be sure the G2P library is built and in your library path (eg. LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
    For more information see 'cpp/README'.

    Using the Python shell from the project "python" directory execute the following:

        $ python
        >>> from g2p import *
        >>> g2p = G2P()
        >>> dict = DictionaryFile().from_file('test_data/setswana-dict/setswana.dict')
        >>> g2p.set_dictionary(dict)
        >>> g2p.update_rules()
        >>> phones = g2p.predict_pronunciation('hello')
        >>> print "result:", phones

    Run regression test cases:

        $ python g2p.py

Installing
----------

    From the "python" directory execute the following with super-user privilages:
    
    $ python setup.py install
